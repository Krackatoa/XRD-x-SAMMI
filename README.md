# Guilty Gear Xrd x SAMMI
Connect to Xrd, Do Crimes! A Bridge Extension for Sammi in their .sef javascript format. Allows you to connect to [super-continent's ggxrd-mod](https://github.com/super-continent/ggxrd-mod).

Simply install as a Bridge Extension inside SAMMI, and run Guilty Gear Xrd to automatically connect.

The "Xrd_Data" button should automatically populate with data at a 60Hz rate while inside a match, while Extension Triggers are used for everything else. Check out [the Xrd Websocket mod](https://github.com/super-continent/ggxrd-mod) for more information.
