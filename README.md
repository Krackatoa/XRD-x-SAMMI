# Guilty Gear Xrd x SAMMI

A Bridge Extension for [SAMMI](https://sammi.solutions). Take interactions in game and turn them into stream gimmicks!

## Extension Function

This extension allows you to receive data from [ggxrd-mod](https://github.com/super-continent/ggxrd-mod) in the form of Extension Triggers inside SAMMI. A collection of example buttons have been provided with some experimental functionality to get you started.

## Using the Mod

### Important Notes

#### Run Bridge in a regular browser instead of the embedded OBS dock for better performance.

Apparently, OBS can't handle our data. It's too much.

#### Run SAMMI at framerates >60FPS to stop button events from backing up. 

It's a SAMMI thing. This can affect commands like Motion, so if you need to animate things in OBS, I recommend the OBS Move plug-in.

### Accessing Events via Extension Triggers

The following Extension Triggers are available for use. Add them to buttons via a button's Trigger menu. They all contain extremely relevant data within that can be accessed via the `Trigger Pull Data` command.

| Extension Trigger | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ggxrd_stateUpdate`| Occurs once a frame. Contains all sorts of cool gamestate data. |
| `ggxrd_hitEvent` | Occurs on Hit or Block. Contains relevant data. |
| `ggxrd_objectCreatedEvent` | Triggers on Object Generation. These can be logic objects, projectiles or special effects. |
| `ggxrd_roundStartEvent` | Triggers on Round Start. |
| `ggxrd_roundEndEvent` | Triggers on Round End. |
| `ggxrd_comboEndEvent` | Combo Summary! Corrals all the data from the last combo. |
| `ggxrd_gamestateDeinitializedEvent` | Triggers when you leave a match or the application closes mid-match. |

### Example of Detecting Level 3 Mist Finer.
This is in the Commands screen of a button set up with the `ggxrd_hitEvent` Extension Trigger. The ggxrd_hitEvent trigger sends along it's own data object that you access with `Trigger Pull Data`.
